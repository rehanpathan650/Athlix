       <div>üìñ Extended Story</div>
       <p>Athlix started with a simple thought: what if sportswear wasn‚Äôt just for athletes?
         The team behind Athlixgrew up loving both fashion and fitness, but struggled to find gear
        that could transition seamlessly from the gym to the street. 
        Sneakers were either too sporty for casual wear or too delicate for real training. Apparel was either
        comfortable but bland, or stylish but impractical.</p>
        <p>We wanted to bridge that gap. So, Athlix was born ‚Äî an ecommerce 
          brand dedicated to creating sportswear that‚Äôs versatile, durable, and stylish enough to 
          wear every day. What began as late-night brainstorming sessions and countless 
          sketches slowly turned into prototypes, samples, and finally, a full-fledged brand.</p>
        <p>Every product we design carries that DNA: the determination to perform, the style to stand out, and the comfort to carry you through every part of your day.</p>
       <br />
       <div>üèÜ Our Mission</div>
       <p>Our mission at Athlix is simple: make sportswear accessible, stylish, and empowering for everyone.</p>
       <p>We don‚Äôt just want to sell shoes or t-shirts ‚Äî we want to redefine what sportswear means in
         everyday life. To us, it‚Äôs not about being the fastest runner or the strongest lifter.
         It‚Äôs about confidence, self-expression, and the freedom to move the way you want.</p>
